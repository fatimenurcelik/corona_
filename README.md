# Corona Language
Lex and Lexial Analysis for our "Corona" Language that an infectious pandemic disease. This project done for Programming Languages lesson homework at Akdeniz University Computer Science Engineering program. 

"Corona Language" inspired heavily by Java. But this language designed as Turkish language. And syntax in CAPSLOCK form mostly. Only functions defined as "abcdEfg" type. 


Let's have a look our language: 


EGER (SAYI yas KUCUKESIT 65) [

ekranaYaz ("Stay Home");]

YADA (kronikhastalik ESIT DOGRU)[

ekranaYaz ("Stay Home too");]

YOKSA [

ekranaYaz ("Stay Home please!!");]



In Java;


If (int yas <= 65){

println("Stay Home");

}else if(kronikhastalik == true){

println("Stay Home too");

}else{

println("Stay Home please!!"); 

}



As you can see, if we compare both of them, "If" equals "EGER" in our language. We added scan as "tara", for classes "BOLUM" and for functions we added "CALISTIR" . If you want to see all codes, please have a look at corona.l file. 



If you want to improve my code, please comment me. Your feedbacks are important. Thank you, Fatimenur ÇELİK.
